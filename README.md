# Reflection
A program that can analyze the capabilities of classes is called reflective.

1. What is reflection?

"Reflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine." This concept is often mixed with introspection. The following are their definitions from Wiki:
Introspection is the ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.
Reflection is the ability of a program to examine and modify the structure and behavior of an object at runtime.
From their definitions, introspection is a subset of reflection. Some languages support introspection, but do not support reflection, e.g., C++.
